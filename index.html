												<p class="caption">Software Engineer | Lockheed Martin</p>
										  		<p class="details">As an engineer on LM Space's ISIM team for SBIRS/OPIR, I was deeply involved in developing a range of critical features and support tools. Among these accomplishments, I spearheaded the creation of essential ISIM functionalities like the Active Ports Display and the COMs State Display Color Coding. Leveraging Java, I engineered innovative solutions such as auto-population of command parameters in Simulator Visualization. One of my notable projects involved orchestrating the transition from legacy C++ to Java for satellite/simulator hex command generation. This encompassed comprehensive tasks such as command validation, database-wide command generation, and crafting specialized tools for interpreting vehicle-reported health and telemetry data. These endeavors have not only enriched our team's capabilities but have also significantly enhanced the effectiveness and reliability of our systems.</p>

										  		<p class="details">As an intern on the LM Enterprise Operations OTD team, I focused on my intern project and various smaller engineering tasks. For my intern project, I conducted a comprehensive business needs analysis and problem identification, leading to the development of a plan for a universal alert/messaging microservice. Designed, developed, tested, and deployed an end-to-end universal Slack Messaging Microservice using Slack APIs, enabling applications to leverage HTTP POST requests for efficient backend application/project alerts. The final microservice was built using Python-based Flask app in a Docker container and deployed on VMware Tanzu (PCF), ensuring scalability and robustness. This project required a deep understanding of system architecture, API integration, and containerization technologies, and demonstrated my proficiency in developing and deploying complex microservices for real-world applications.</p>

											<p  class="details">As tech professionals, it's easy to become absorbed in our daily responsibilities. However, taking time to travel or go on vacation is crucial for long-term success. A break from routine not only provides rest but also offers fresh perspectives and ideas. Traveling allows individuals to step out of their comfort zones, learn about new cultures, and gain valuable experiences that can enhance their work. Moreover, taking time off to relax and recharge can lead to increased productivity and creativity upon returning. Balancing work and leisure helps tech professionals achieve their goals while maintaining a fulfilling personal life.</p>

										  		<p class="details">Colorado is known for its world-class skiing destinations, attracting visitors from all over the globe. With over 300 days of sunshine and an average annual snowfall of 300 inches, Colorado offers some of the best skiing experiences in the world. Being a Colorado native, I started off at Loveland Ski Area as a child, where I took lessons and practiced until I was comfortable enough to hit the slopes on my own. Now, I can't get enough of skiing in Colorado! From the groomers at Breckenridge to the steep and deep runs at Telluride, I love attacking any terrain that comes my way. There's something special about the snow, the views, and the atmosphere that makes skiing in Colorado an unforgettable experience. Every time I hit the mountain, I feel a sense of exhilaration and freedom that's hard to replicate anywhere else. Whether you're a seasoned pro or just starting out, I highly recommend trying out skiing in Colorado - you won't be disappointed!</p>

													Cars are more than transportation to me, they're a passion and way of life. I began with my own Chrysler Sebring convertible, and worked my way up to my Mercedes-Benz, modifying and tuning it and taking it to the track. Living in Colorado has only enhanced my love for automobiles with endless opportunities to enjoy them. I'm also a former member of the CU Car Club, learning and connecting with like-minded individuals. Working on cars taught me discipline, patience, and rather valuable problem-solving skills, and has me always looking for the next challenge.</p>
